- Use a daka.cfg.xml file to store information about the database of the ORM user.
    - Include: db endpoint address, db port, db master username, db master password
    - Possibly include: table names? Column names?

- Use annotations to provide db information (table name, column name, IDs/primary keys).
    - Can edit already-existing classes.
    - Don't need to read from mapping .xml files (the alternative).

- Create some type of Session class/object that reads from daka.cfg.xml to establish the db connection.
    - The Session would start, read data from cfg.xml, connect to the db, and process db operations
      until it's closed.

- For CRUD operations: Use Reflection to get the values of the fields in the passed-in Object.
    - These fields will correspond with the columns in the db table. Then, find a way to structure
      a JDBC PreparedStatement with variable fields/columns.
